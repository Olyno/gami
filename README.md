        Game myFirstGame = new Game("myFirstGame");
        Team redTeam = new Team("red", myFirstGame);
        Team blueTeam = new Team("blue", myFirstGame);
        myFirstGame.start();
    }

}
```

## Getting started

First, you need to add the JitPack repository at the END of all your repositories. Gami is not available in Maven Central.

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
    ...
    maven {
        url 'https://jitpack.io'
    }
}
```

or if you use Maven

```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Then you will also need to add Gami as a dependency.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Olyno:Gami:[versionTag]'
}
```

or if you use Maven

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.Olyno</groupId>
    <artifactId>Gami</artifactId>
    <version>[versionTag]</version>
</dependency>
```
